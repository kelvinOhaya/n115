      A common nasal spray may block Covid infection, trial results indicate
    </h1>

      An over-the-counter nasal spray which has been used for years as a safe
      and effective treatment for seasonal allergies could potentially prevent
      Covid infections, according to clinical trial results released Tuesday.
      The antihistamine azelastine works as an antiviral against a range of
      respiratory infections, including influenza, RSV and the virus that causes
      Covid, a growing number of studies have shown. German scientists at
      Saarland University Hospital recruited 450 adults, mostly in their early
      30s. The first group of 227 participants tested a puff of the nasal spray
      in each nostril, three times a day. The other 223 were instructed to do
      the same, but with a placebo spray. All participants were given Covid
      rapid tests twice a week over the course of nearly two months. By the end,
      the incidence of Covid infections in the azelastine group was 2.2%,
      significantly lower than the 6.7% infection rate in the placebo group.
      Azelastine also appeared to reduce rates of other symptomatic respiratory
      infections, in general, the study published in JAMA Internal Medicine,
      found. The researchers said they were not entirely sure why azelastine
      appears to be effective at limiting Covid infections, but they suggested
      that it might bind to the virus in the nasal mucosa, the moist membrane
      lining the nose which pathogens must navigate to enter the body, and
      inhibits a key enzyme that it uses to replicate. Another possibility is
      that azelastine interacts with the ACE2 receptor, the preferred entry
      point which the Covid virus uses to access human cells, and prevents it
      from latching on. “Our findings suggest azelastine could serve as a
      scalable, over-the-counter prophylactic against Covid, especially when
      community transmission is elevated or in high-risk settings such as
      crowded indoor events or travelling,” said Dr. Robert Bals, professor of
      internal medicine and pneumology at Saarland University and the study’s
      senior author. The trial had limitations, namely that the participants
      were all young and relatively healthy, he said. Bals said that azelastine
      should not be seen as a replacement for vaccinations, and larger studies
      were needed before recommending it as a routine preventative measure for
      the general public, and especially vulnerable groups.
